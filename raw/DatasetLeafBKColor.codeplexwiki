!!! Overview
leafbackground colors will change the colors of leaf background. Similar to branch colors, multiple datasets can be uploaded to a tree, but only one can be shown at a time.
Here is an example:

{anchor:modifiers}
!!! Supported modifiers
Supported Key-Value pairs for leaf colors:
||Key (case insensitive)||Value||Description||
|!Groups or !LegendText|comma separated text|Legend texts; for example 'group_a,group_b,group_c'|
|!LegendStyle or !Style|rect or circle or star|shapes to be plotted before the legend texts; default = rect|
|!LegendColors or !Colors|comma separated color codes or names|colors to be applied to the shapes specified by LegendStyle; for example 'red,green,yellow' ; note the number of colors should match the number of legend fields|
|!Title or !Legend|text|title of the legend; default = name of the dataset|
|!ShowLegends|0 or 1|0 : hide legends; 1 : show legends|
|!opacity|float number between 0 to 1|opacity of the dataset|

{anchor:data}
!!! the data
Data are usually tab-delimited three-column texts, with the third column optional.
Let me use the tree below to illustrate the usage of the data:
{{
(chicken,((mouse,rat),(chimp,human)));
}}
* *first column: the location*
the first column dictates where the data to be plotted. It usually contains the name of a leaf node, or two leaf names separated by a ','.
* one single leaf name dictates that the data will be plotted on / next to / under the leaf or the branch connecting directly to the leaf node
* two leaf names are often used in combination with an 'ad' at the third column; see the section 'third column' for more details.
For example:
{{
chicken
mouse,human
}}
* *second column: color to be applied*
For example:
{{
chicken	green
mouse,human	blue
}}

* *third column: optional commands to change the default behavior of current line*
By default, the color will only apply to the specified leaf label; for example:
{{
## leaf background color
mouse	red
}}

By adding a third column, the default behavior can be changed. Here is a list of choices of this column:
||Option (case insensitive)||Description||
|ad|apply color to the leaf labels of all descendants|
|prefix|apply color to all leaf labels that start with the string specified by the first column|
|suffix|apply color to all leaf labels that end with the string specified by the first column|
|anywhere|apply color to leaf labels that contain the string specified by the first column|
See examples below.

!!! Add leaf background color to a collapsed tree
Evolview supports collapsing at internal nodes; collapsed nodes are treated as leaf nodes. It is therefore very straightforward to add leaf background color to a collapsed tree. See [here|DatasetCollapseInternalNodes#LeafAndLeafBKcolors] for more information.
