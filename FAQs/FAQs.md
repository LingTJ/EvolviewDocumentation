### Tree and datasets are correctly displayed, but exporting to any graphic formats including SVG does not work

This issue is likely due to very large trees and datasets.
Here is a workaround using Google Chrome:
* right click at any empty places on the canvas, select "inspect" from the popup menu;
* click "Elements" in the popup window
* find the "SVG" element;
* right click on the "SVG", select "Copy" -> "Copy element" from the popup menu;
* paste the copied contents into a newly created text file and save it as a SVG file.
