### Performance of Evolview

Trees are parsed and visualized on the client side, therefore the size of the tree and the speed of visualization are limited by usersâ€™ hardware. 

Based on our tests on a 4-year old MacbookPro, Evolview could parse and visualize two trees with 2,000 and 4,000 species in ~7 and ~17 seconds, respectively. Therefore Evolview is capable of handling large trees in reasonable time.

Below are the two trees we have tested; note there are zipped and in PhyloXML format.
# tree with 2000 leaf nodes: [tree2k_phyloxml.txt.zip](evolviewperformance_tree2k_phyloxml.txt.zip)
# tree with 4000 leaf nodes: [tree4k_phyloxml.txt.zip](evolviewperformance_tree4k_phyloxml.txt.zip)
